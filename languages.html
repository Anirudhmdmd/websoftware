		<h2>
1.HTML </h2>
<p>HTML is a markup language that is the basis of website construction. It tells browsers how to render web pages.</p>
 Although it is not programming in the traditional sense, HTML often requires extensive coding and may be challenging to learn.


<h2>
2.Java Script</h2>
<p>

JavaScript is a common web development language for its simplicity, which develops use to dynamically create web pages. It is also one of the world's oldest coding languages</p>.

In 1995, Brendan Eichs, an employee of Netscape Communications, developed JavaScript. He designed the language to complement Java, Netscape Navigator Sun's programming language. The two languages use similar syntax.

Originally, Netscape named its new language Mocha but quickly changed it to JavaScript. In 1996, Microsoft decided to compete with Netscape by using JavaScript inside its new Internet Explorer 3.

<h2>
3.CSS</h2>
<p>
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML)</p>
 CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
<h2>
4.Python
</h2>
<p>
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.</p>

<p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. </p>It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[35][36]

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[37] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2
